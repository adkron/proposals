Splat, splat, splat it on out

Abstract (public, 600 characters)
--------

Ruby is a language we all love. It has an elegance and aesthetic
that is rivaled by few. The more we learn about the language the
deeper our love becomes. Some areas of Ruby are underutilized
outside of the very seasoned. Learning one of these corners can
open up a whole new world of ideas. Let's dive into one corner and
learn how we can utilize some basic pattern matching found in other
languages. You just might change some of your current code.

Pitch (why this talk, why me?)
-----

I've been writing Ruby since 2005 and Rails since 2006. I took over
the local Ruby group in 2011. I love Ruby because of
its power and elegance. As a consultant I find myself disappointed
when I find teams that are not taking advantage of the built-in
elegance and object oriented designs that are so simple in the
language we all love. I want to teach the world one small step at
a time. I've spoken many times at the local Ruby group and it has
lead to many people asking me to help them or their teams. I want
to bring these ideas to a wider audience and become more involved
in the community that has given so much to me.

Splat is a Ruby operator that is underutilized and simple to understand.
I believe this a good place to start to step past the beauty of
Enumerable and really appreciate the language. Using splat touches
on implicit and explicit conversion that can be introduced to the
less seasoned Rubyists. In the recent past there has been a big push
towards functional styles and languages that support pattern matching
and although it doesn't get us all the way there the splat does lead us
to some poor person's pattern matching. I believe that learning this
simple and elegant operator opens up a new world of possibilities for
playing and growing.
